Primarily a test for building colored overlays on sprites, this will add a
variant to the regular handcuffs that have a randomly colored fur sleeve.
Perfect for... "special interrogation".

NOTE: I included a separate .dmi file so it's a simpler merge.

================================================================================
GPL
================================================================================
https://github.com/kyrahabattoir/-tg-station-GPL

Now with independent repository!

A /tg/station branch that doesn't contain any AGPL code (GPLv3 only).
Unless someone wishes to rewrite the AGPL sections of the /tg/station codebase
under a GPLv3 license, this might become old quickly but is still a solid base
for an ss13 project.

Obviously, it needs work, bugfix and improvement PRs are welcome as long as they
are GPLv3 only.
